NeatMe takes away poor user experience of note taking and effortlessly enables you to quickly record short notes, internet links, pictures from your album, camera snaps and store them in folders you have created for easy access in the future. If you are lazy, just use the voice recogniser on your keyboard to take notes. 

Apart from that, NeatMe allows you to grab your favourite place's Business Name, address, GPS location and telephone number through our 'Places' feature. You can do this by clicking the 'Marker' icon when adding 'New Note'.

On top of that, you could reorganize them to different folders if you need to do so, set reminders that trigger through your notification drawer and mark any of them which were completed. Folders and notes are sortable according to how you visually prioritise them. It's just drag and drop.

You could also view what's listed in your reminders as well as those recently marked as completed on your Dashboard. To top it off, it's easily configurable by number of days you would like to see. All from the Settings page. Just in case you are more of a calendar view person and always prefer an overview of what's ahead over the weeks, there's an intuitive calendar view for all your reminders.

If your list grows huge, your worries are easily addressed by the Search feature we have for you. Type a keyword and it's all filtered for you.
